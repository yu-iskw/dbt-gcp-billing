          Contains detailed Cloud Billing account cost usage information.
          Includes everything in the standard usage cost data plus resource-level cost data, like a virtual machine or SSD that generates service usage.

          Use the Detailed usage export to analyze costs at the resource level, and identify specific resources that might be driving up costs.
          The detailed export includes resource-level information for the following products:

          Compute Engine
          Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
          Cloud Functions
          Cloud Run
